She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation? (A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization (B) Complication of the IVC filter placement (C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and (D) Hematoma of the left thigh.

At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?

"A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive.

"A phase 2, multicenter trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of a new vaccine for prevention of HIV infection. The study enrolled 4000 subjects, aged 20 to 65 years. Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects.

"A 3-year-old boy with chronic granulomatous disease is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of fever and warm, red lumps under both arms. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows enlarged, 3-cm, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. On palpation, the nodes are tender, fluctuant, and movable. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, βhemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive.

"An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection.

"A 16-year-old male is brought to the emergency department with sudden-onset swelling of the right knee. He denies any trauma. Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month.

The patient reports no new symptoms except for shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise that began 3 months ago when he tried to increase the distance of his daily walk from 1 mile to 3 miles. He has not had orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest pain. Additional medical history is significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient also has a heart murmur that was discovered at an armed forces screening physical examination at age 18 years, but it did not prevent him from serving in the military. Medications are metoprolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril, omeprazole, and a low dose of prednisone every other day. The patient is active and manages a small farm. BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 60/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 124/61 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a normal S1, pronounced S2, and a grade 2/6 late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border. Pulses are normal in contour.

"A 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation comes to the emergency department because of pain in his right thigh and shaking chills during the past 3 days.

"A 43-year-old man with a history of self-mutilation comes to the emergency department because of pain in his right thigh and shaking chills during the past 3 days. He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of ""greenish fluid"" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2°C (102.5°F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3 .

Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease, for which he takes atorvastatin, furosemide, carvedilol, lisinopril, and 81-mg aspirin. Baseline echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 0.20. Vital signs now are temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination discloses no unexpected abnormalities. Which of the following regimens for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis will likely be most beneficial in this patient? (A) Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices (B) Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value (C) Oral warfarin and (D) Subcutaneous enoxaparin.

"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for follow-up of a chromosome analysis done 1 month ago. The child has minor dysmorphic features, and growth and developmental delay. Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3. The cytogenetics laboratory requested blood samples from both parents for follow-up studies. The parents are divorced, and the mother has custody of the child. The relationship between the parents is hostile. The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation. At today's visit, she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised. She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child. She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father, who could be a translocation carrier. You do not know the father, but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town. The mother says that he is living with a new girlfriend. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step? (A) Attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father (B) Contact the father by telephone and arrange for him to give a blood sample at a local hospital (C) Document your attempts to work with the mother but proceed no further, since you have no physician-patient relationship with the father and (D) Help the mother deal with her anger and educate her regarding the potential benefit to her son and others if the father's chromosome studies are done.
