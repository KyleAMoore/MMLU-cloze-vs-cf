(A) The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did. (B) Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained. (C) The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water. and (D) The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1..
