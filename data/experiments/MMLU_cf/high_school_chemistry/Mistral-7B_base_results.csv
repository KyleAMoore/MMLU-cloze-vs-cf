(A) The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did. (B) Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained. (C) The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water. and (D) The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1..

The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why? (A) Limestone is never pure CaCO3. (B) Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2. (C) Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water. and (D) Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone..

"During the study of the reaction A → 2B, a chemist constructs several graphs. The graph of [A] versus time and the graph of ln [A] versus time both give a curved line; however, the graph of 1/[A] versus time and gives a straight line. This implies the rate law is (A) Rate = k[A] (B) Rate = k[A]^2 (C) Rate = k[A]^0 and (D) Rate = k[A]^-1.
