"Languages with a structure that implements abstract data types (e.g., a C++ class) can prevent access to components of this structure by all operations except those that are part of this structure. However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true? I. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time. II. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable. III. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.

"Two alternatives for interconnecting a set of processors with bidirectional links are (1) the fully interconnected network, in which each processor is directly connected to every other processor, and (2) the ring network, in which each processor is connected to two other processors.

"Function signatures describe the types of the arguments to a function as well as the return value of the function. For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of add : real x real -> real since it takes two real numbers and returns a real number.

Which of the following best characterizes the height h of any tree in this class, where N is the number of nodes in the tree and N > 1 ? (A) h <= log2(N) (B) h = 1/c * log2(N) (C) h < c log2(N) and (D) h > c log2(N).

(A) Actual parameters of the active procedures (B) Dynamically allocated objects on the heap (C) Global variables of the program and (D) Local variables on the call stack.
