"In a high school of 1650 students, 132 have personal investments in the stock market. To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment.

"In a clinic, 50 patients with sleep disorders are randomly assigned to one of two different groups. Patients in one group are given medication before bedtime. Patients in the other group are given blindfolds and played soft music at bedtime. Each patient is attached to a machine that records breathing patterns. From the patterns, it is possible to determine if the patient is awake or asleep. The data will be used to decide which method is more effective in helping patients with sleep disorders. Which of the following statements is correct in the context of this experiment? (A) It is not possible for this experiment to be single-blind or double-blind, because human subjects are involved. (B) This is only a single-blind experiment because the experimenters did not include a control group that received neither medication nor a blindfold and soft music. (C) This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving, although the examining doctor might not. and (D) This is a double-blind experiment because the experimenters could prevent both groups of patients from knowing what sort of treatment the other group is receiving..

"Biologists around the world have increased efforts at conservation. Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.

He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason? (A) Because tis more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams. (B) Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams. (C) Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams. and (D) Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams..

"Self-efficacy (the belief that one has control over one's situation) as it related to job satisfaction was studied. When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30.
