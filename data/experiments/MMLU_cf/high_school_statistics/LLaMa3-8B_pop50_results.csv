"In a high school of 1650 students, 132 have personal investments in the stock market. To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment.

"Tina’s science fair project was to estimate the mean amount of chemicals in her city’s water supply. At first, she had decided to use a random sample of 15 observations. But her teacher asked her to take 35 observations. The mean and standard deviation from 35 observations turned out to be approximately the same as those from 15 observations. Is there any advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15 observations? (A) There is no advantage. Because the mean and the standard deviation are about the same, the confidence interval computed using 35 observations should be approximately the same as that computed using 15 observations. (B) There is no advantage. In fact, the 20 extra observations will increase the likelihood of error. (C) There is no advantage. Because she took 35 observations instead of 15 observations, the confidence interval using 35 observations will be wider than that using 15 observations. and (D) There is some advantage.

"An assembly line machine is supposed to turn out ball bearings with a diameter of 1.25 centimeters. Each morning the first 30 bearings produced are pulled and measured. If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: μ = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: μ ≠ 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?

"A study is made to determine whether more hours of academic studying leads to higher point scoring by basketball players.

Each of the five managers will be asked to place the 200 time cards of their respective employees in a bag, shake them up, and randomly draw out six names. The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample. Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees?

"A school board of a large school district is proposing a new dress code for students. Some students feel that this dress code unfairly targets female students. To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate? (A) The sample sizes are different.

"A reading specialist in a large public school system believes that the more time students spend reading, the better they will do in school. She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design? (A) Yes. (B) No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.

(C) About 95% of polls conducted in this way will find that between 39.8% and 46.2% of those sampled approve of the job the president is doing. and (D) About 95% of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2 percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing..

"To determine the average number of children living in single-family homes, a researcher picks a simple random sample of 50 such homes. However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high? (A) Too low, because of undercoverage bias. (B) Too low, because convenience samples overestimate average results. (C) Too high, because of undercoverage bias. and (D) Too high, because convenience samples overestimate average results..

"Self-efficacy (the belief that one has control over one's situation) as it related to job satisfaction was studied. When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30. Which statement follows from this correlation? (A) If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.

"The mean thrust of a certain model jet engine is 9500 pounds. Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust, an inspector tests a sample of units, calculating a mean of 9350 pounds with a z-score of -2.46 and a P-value of 0.0069.
