"The Gravitron is a carnival ride that looks like a large cylinder. People stand inside the cylinder against the wall as it begins to spin. Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person’s clothing and the wall is μ, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?
