"Plato's suggestion that knowledge is innate or remembered as a result of being triggered by experience is in response to a paradox he sets up for himself.  The paradox, now referred to as Meno's Paradox, has to do with the question of: (A) how a person can remember anything about the realm of the Forms after the shock of being born into this world. (B) how knowledge of the Forms can ever be anything other than a generalization of experience. (C) how anyone can recognize the correct answer to a question without already knowing the answer. and (D) how concepts bound to the realm of becoming have meaning only when associated with the realm of Being..

"According to Socrates, it is important that we discover what makes a particular action (e.g., a merciful or just act) the kind of action that it is, because without such knowledge: (A) no one in society will ever do any action that really is merciful or just, only those actions that they think are merciful or just. (B) the primary purpose of human existence--which is to think and to know--is replaced by a focus on morality (acting and doing). (C) we can refer only to how people characterize actions without knowing why such actions should be characterized that way. and (D) there would be no way to distinguish one kind of action (e.g., a merciful action) from another kind of action (e.g., a just action)..
