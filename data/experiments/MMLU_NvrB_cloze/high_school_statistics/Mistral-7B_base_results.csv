He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, ""Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?"" He counted the number of customers answering ""yes"" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays.

"In a clinic, 50 patients with sleep disorders are randomly assigned to one of two different groups. Patients in one group are given medication before bedtime. Patients in the other group are given blindfolds and played soft music at bedtime. Each patient is attached to a machine that records breathing patterns.

"A study is made to determine whether more hours of academic studying leads to higher point scoring by basketball players. In surveying 50 basketball players, it is noted that the 25 who claim to study the most hours have a higher point average than the 25 who study less.

Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.
