(B) The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius. (C) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. (D) The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.. Of the answer choices above, the best answer choice is (",B,0,high_school_physics,[-7.444978713989258]
