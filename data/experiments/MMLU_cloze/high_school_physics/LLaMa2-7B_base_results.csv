"An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit? (A) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth. (B) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. (C) The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius. and (D) The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius..
