Dr. Thompson asks Dr. Stone to review the preliminary report she has prepared for the project; and, in doing so, Dr. Stone discovers that some of the reported data is misleading and may be inaccurate. Dr. Stone expresses his concerns to Dr. Thompson and is told that “it will be taken care of.” Subsequently, Dr. Stone learns that the report was submitted to the company without any changes. Dr. Stone reviews the ethical guidelines and decides that pursuing the matter further isn't necessary.

(B) is correct since he has already attempted to resolve the matter in an informal manner as proscribed by ethical guidelines. (C) is correct since it is the project director’s responsibility to provide the company with complete and accurate data. and (D) is incorrect because he has a responsibility to ensure that the company is provided with complete and accurate data..
