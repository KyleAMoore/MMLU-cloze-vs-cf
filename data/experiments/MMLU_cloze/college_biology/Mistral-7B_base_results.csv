"A recent theory concerning an unusual rise in asthma attacks following a thunderstorm proposes that while pollen grains at 5 microns are too large to enter the airways, their exposure to water precipitates the release of starch granules as a result of osmotic shock.

(A) The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. (B) The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.
