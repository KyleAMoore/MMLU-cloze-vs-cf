(A) The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment. (B) The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment. (C) The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents. (D) The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents..
