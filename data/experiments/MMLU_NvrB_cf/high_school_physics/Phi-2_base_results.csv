(A) μv^2/(rg) (B) r^2v^2/(μg) (C) None of the above. (D) rg/(μv^2). Of the answer choices above, answer (D) is the",best,0,high_school_physics,[-3.3353004455566406]
"An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit? (A) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth. (B) The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius. (C) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. (D) The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.. Of the answer choices above, answer (A) is the",best,0,high_school_physics,[-2.9291954040527344]
