(A) The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2. (B) The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively. (C) The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP. (D) The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2..
