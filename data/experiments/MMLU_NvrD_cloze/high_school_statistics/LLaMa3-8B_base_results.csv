He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, ""Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?"" He counted the number of customers answering ""yes"" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays.

Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.

"A farmer who raises hens for egg production wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56 grams. He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason? (A) Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams. (B) Because tis more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject the null hypothesis.
