"MIT’s Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used? (A) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket’s expiration time to the server’s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past. (B) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets. (C) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket’s maximum lifetime. (D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC’s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired..
