(D) The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.. Of the answer choices above, the best answer choice is (",A,1,high_school_physics,[-0.8897171020507812]
"An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity.
