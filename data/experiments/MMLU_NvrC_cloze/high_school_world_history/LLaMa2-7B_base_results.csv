"This question refers to the following information. Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe. The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history? (A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other (B) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E. (C) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion (D) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.

"This question refers to the following information. In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

"This question refers to the following information. Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day.

And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

National Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966 Source 3: ""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature. As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

"This question refers to the following information. In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.

"This question refers to the following information. In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

"This question refers to the following information. Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out. Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.

She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak.

When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.""

"This question refers to the following information. ""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

"This question refers to the following information. Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out. Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors. Heinrich von Füch, ""On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,"" 1744 Both passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?

You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action.

"This question refers to the following information. I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on. A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day. ""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen, And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west. On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us. When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest. The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean, But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest. In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han, There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest. Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow, The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess. It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters: They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.

"This question refers to the following information. ""Purusa-Sukta"" Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation. It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep. When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds.

"This question refers to the following information. Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror.

It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.""

"This question refers to the following information. Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities. —Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year…. And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.

No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans.

"This question refers to the following information. In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

In fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race — by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands. British journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860 Violence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a ""humanness""; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals. Rudrangshu Mukherjee, ""The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,"" 1990 From the perspective of the first passage, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore (A) should be seen as a regrettable but avoidable mistake. (B) can be said to have been brought on by the British themselves. (C) was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty. (D) seems to mark a betrayal of a ""higher"" race by a ""lesser"" race..

Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices: A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries. They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping. An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful. A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody. How was the Arab trade in Africans different from the Atlantic slave trade? (A) Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did. (B) Unlike Arab slave merchants, those involved in the Atlantic slave trade were motivated by religion. (C) Slaves taken for the Atlantic trade were predominantly female; slaves taken by Arab merchants were mostly male. (D) Slaves taken by Arab merchants were likely to have a shorter life span than those taken for the Atlantic trade..

"This question refers to the following information. Every two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potosí have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out. Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potosí, 1620s The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors. Heinrich von Füch, ""On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,"" 1744 Which of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?
