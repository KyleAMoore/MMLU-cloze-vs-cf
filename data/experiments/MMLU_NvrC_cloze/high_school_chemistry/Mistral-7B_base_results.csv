(A) It would be greater than both because potassium carries a greater nuclear charge then either chlorine or argon. (B) It would be less than both because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon. (C) It would be greater than both because the size of a potassium atom is smaller than an atom of either chlorine or argon. (D) It would be less than both because there are more electrons in potassium, meaning they repel each other more effectively and less energy is needed to remove one..
