He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, ""Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?"" He counted the number of customers answering ""yes"" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays.

"A study is made to determine whether more hours of academic studying leads to higher point scoring by basketball players. In surveying 50 basketball players, it is noted that the 25 who claim to study the most hours have a higher point average than the 25 who study less.

Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.

"A reading specialist in a large public school system believes that the more time students spend reading, the better they will do in school. She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design? (A) Yes. (B) No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship. (C) No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration. (D) No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect..
