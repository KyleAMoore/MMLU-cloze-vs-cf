For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of add : real x real -> real since it takes two real numbers and returns a real number.

"The hit ratio of a cache memory is the percentage of accesses (reads and writes) for which data are found in the cache. Write-through is a policy whereby every write operation updates main memory. Write-back is a policy whereby a write operation to a line found in the cache does not affect main memory until the line is evicted from the cache.
