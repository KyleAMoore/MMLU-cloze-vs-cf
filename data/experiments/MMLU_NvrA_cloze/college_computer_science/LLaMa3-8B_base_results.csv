Which of the following best characterizes the height h of any tree in this class, where N is the number of nodes in the tree and N > 1 ? (A) h <= log2(N) (B) h = 1/c * log2(N) (C) h < c log2(N) (D) h > c log2(N). Of the answer choices above, the best answer choice is (",D,0,college_computer_science,[-2.1145477294921875]

Consider the product of three matrices N_1N_2N_3 that have, respectively, w rows and x columns, x rows and y columns, and y rows and z columns. Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)?
