It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential. (B) Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential. (C) Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential. (D) Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential..
