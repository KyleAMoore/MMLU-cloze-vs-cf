"The hit ratio of a cache memory is the percentage of accesses (reads and writes) for which data are found in the cache. Write-through is a policy whereby every write operation updates main memory. Write-back is a policy whereby a write operation to a line found in the cache does not affect main memory until the line is evicted from the cache. Write-allocation is a policy whereby a cache line is allocated and loaded on a write-miss. If it is assumed that write-allocation is always used, which of the following is true?
