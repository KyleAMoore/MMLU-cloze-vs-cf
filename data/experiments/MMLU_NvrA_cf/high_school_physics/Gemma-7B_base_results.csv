Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person’s clothing and the wall is μ, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride? (A) μv^2/(rg) (B) r^2v^2/(μg) (C) rg/(μv^2) (D) None of the above.. Of the answer choices above, answer (D) is the",best,1,high_school_physics,[-3.195526123046875]
"An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit? (A) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth. (B) The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius. (C) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. (D) The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.. Of the answer choices above, answer (A) is the",best,0,high_school_physics,[-1.5143871307373047]
