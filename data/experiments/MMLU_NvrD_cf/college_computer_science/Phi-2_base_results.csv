Which of the following best characterizes the height h of any tree in this class, where N is the number of nodes in the tree and N > 1 ? (A) h < c log2(N) (B) h <= log2(N) (C) h = 1/c * log2(N) (D) h > c log2(N). Of the answer choices above, answer (D) is the",best,0,college_computer_science,[-1.8485908508300781]

Consider the product of three matrices N_1N_2N_3 that have, respectively, w rows and x columns, x rows and y columns, and y rows and z columns. Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)? (A) There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time. (B) x > y (C) 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y (D) 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z.

"The hit ratio of a cache memory is the percentage of accesses (reads and writes) for which data are found in the cache. Write-through is a policy whereby every write operation updates main memory.
