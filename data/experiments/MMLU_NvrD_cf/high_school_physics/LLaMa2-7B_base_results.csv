Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person’s clothing and the wall is μ, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride? (A) μv^2/(rg) (B) None of the above. (C) r^2v^2/(μg) (D) rg/(μv^2). Of the answer choices above, answer (C) is the",best,0,high_school_physics,[-1.3220386505126953]

"An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit? (A) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. (B) The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth. (C) The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.
